# quis_brain

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): separation into classes such as Question and QuizBrain.

Data handling: storing and iterating through a list of questions.

Game logic: tracking user answers, score, and quiz progress.

Scalability: easy to extend with new questions or different data sources.

This project highlights my understanding of Python fundamentals and OOP concepts, while practicing clean code and modular design.
